# Lost In Space #
30 Days Lost in Space Program from Inventr.io, completed on the custom HERO Board (which mirrors the Arduino UNO R3 board).

Each module is completed as an independent project regardless if one module builds on a previous one.

## IDE Setup ##
Go to <code> Tools > Board > Arduino AVR Boards > Arduino UNO </code> to set the board.  
Go to <code> Tools > Port > COM5/COM6 </code> to set the port. (Depends on which USB port the device is connected to.)

## Library Setup ##
Go to <code> Tools > Manage Libraries... </code> to install libraries.
Day 11 requires <code> Keypad by Mark Stanley, Alexander Bevig </code>.

## Formatting ##
Arduino projects are built in folders, where the name of the folder must match the name of the <code>.ino </code> file or "sketch".

## Schematics ##
Diagrams are modelled in TinkerCAD. UNO board is used instead of the HERO board but the schematics are analogous since the pinout scheme is the same for the analog and digital pins.
