# LostInSpace
30 Days Lost in Space Program from Inventr.io, completed on the custom HERO Board. This is built similarly to the Arduino UNO R3 board.

Each module is completed as an independent project regardless if one module builds on a previous one.

## Formatting ##
Arduino projects are built in folders, where the name of the folder must match the name of the <code>.ino </code> file or "sketch".

## Schematics ##
Diagrams are modelled in TinkerCAD. UNO board is used instead of the HERO board but the schematics are analogous since the pinout scheme is the same for the analog and digital pins.
